# note-bliss

Implement the basic functionality for a note taking app:

- Create a form with a text input and submit button for creating new notes
- When the form is submitted, create a new note object with the entered text and a unique ID, and save it to an array in local storage
- Display a list of all existing notes on the page, showing the note text and a delete button for each 
- When a note's delete button is clicked, remove that note from the array in local storage and update the displayed list
- Allow editing existing notes by clicking on the note text, which should display the note text in a text input. Update the note in local storage and the list when the user presses enter or clicks outside the input.
